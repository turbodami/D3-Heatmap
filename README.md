# Data Eng Interview

I was curious about how different it would be to process data client-side with Javascript, so there are two folders, /client-side-processing and /server-side-processing.

## Installation

Launch nix-shell, install dependencies from the server-side-processing/client folder and run the following command:

```bash
npm run run
```

Runs on port 5000.
